## What's Vibe Coding?

Vibe coding is a style of programming that prioritizes intuition, rapid experimentation, and an uninterrupted “flow” of ideas over strict adherence to syntax or structure. In practical terms, the developer focuses on what they want to achieve (often describing it in plain language) and lets tools – frequently AI – handle the low-level implementation details​

The term was coined by Andrej Karpathy in early 2025 to describe “fully giving in to the vibes” and almost forgetting that the code exists​

> Andrej Karpathy on X: "There's a new kind of coding I call "vibe coding", where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. (.) I'm building a project or webapp, but it's not really coding - I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works".

## AI Coding Assistants

These assistants generally aim to streamline the coding process by offering intelligent suggestions and automating repetitive tasks.
AI coding assistants offer a range of core functionalities designed to enhance the software development process:

- Code Completion and Suggestions
- Natural Language to Code Conversion (Programming by Prompt)
- AI Chat and Explanations

### Assistants

- GitHub Copilot,
- Tabnine,
- Sourcegraph Cody,
- Replit,
- Codiga,
- Amazon Q Developer,
- OpenAI Codex,
- Codeium.
- Amazon CodeWhisperer,
- CodeT5,
- DeepCode AI (Snyk),

## Programming by Prompt Tools

The paradigm of programming by prompt, or natural language to code conversion, is gaining traction, with several tools and frameworks facilitating this approach:

- GitHub Spark: enables users to create micro applications using intuitive natural language instructions, abstracting away the complexities of traditional coding
- CodeT5: notable for its ability to translate natural language descriptions into functional code snippets
- OpenAI Codex: developed by OpenAI, powers GitHub Copilot and can understand and generate code in various programming languages based on natural language prompts
- ChatGPT: another offering from OpenAI, has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text, making it a versatile tool for various coding tasks through prompt engineering

## Marketplaces

Marketplaces for creating, sharing, and discovering effective prompts for AI models, including those used for code generation:

- PromptBase
- PromptHero 

## AI-Powered UX/UI Design Tools

The field of UX/UI design is also experiencing a significant impact from AI, with the emergence of tools designed to assist designers in various stages of the design process:

- Uizard: focuses on translating design ideas into reality without the need for manual coding
- Uizard's Wireframe Scanner: can digitize hand-drawn wireframes, and its Screenshot Scanner can turn screenshots into editable mockups. 
- Attention Insight,
- UX Pilot: aims to provide superfast UX/UI design capabilities through the use of AI
- UX Pilot's Hifi Designer: can instantly create high-fidelity UI designs in seconds using AI
- Motiff: offers an AI-powered professional interface design tool with a focus on efficiency and collaboration.
- Motiff AI Layout: helps in creating structured designs, and an AI Magic Box that suggests the best-fitting UI component based on a dragged box and a text prompt
- Visily: make UI design software accessible to everyone, regardless of their design expertise. Visily's Text to Design feature can convert text prompts into fully customizable high-fidelity UI designs, eliminating the need to start from a blank canvas.
- Visily's Sketch to Design and Screenshot to Design features: allow users to upload sketches or screenshots and convert them into modifiable digital designs.
- Visual Copilot: a Figma plugin that handles the code generation process, converting Figma designs into clean, production-ready code

  
## Extra

LangChain provide developers with the tools to build sophisticated applications with LLMs, including managing and chaining prompts for complex workflows.



## Prompt Engineering Best Practices for Vibe Coding

**Be Specific**

Clearly define the programming language and functionality needed.

"Write a Python function named `calculate_factorial` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns its factorial." 

**Provide Context**

Include relevant background information, libraries, or frameworks being used.

"Write a JavaScript function using the React library to toggle the visibility of a component." 

**Use Action Words**

Start prompts with clear action-oriented verbs.

"Generate a Python script that reads data from a CSV file and outputs the average of a specific column." 

**Specify Output Format**

Indicate the desired format of the generated code (e.g., function, class).

"Create a class in Java that represents a `Person` with attributes for name and age."

**Give Examples**

Provide sample code or desired behavior to guide the AI.

"Here is an example of a function that sorts a list of numbers: `def sort_list(numbers):...`. Write a similar function in C++ to sort a list of strings." 

**Specify Length**

Mention the desired length or complexity of the generated code.

"Write a concise Python function, no more than 10 lines of code, to check if a given string is a palindrome." 

**Clarify Tone**

Specify the desired tone or style of the generated code (e.g., professional).

"Write a well-documented and professional-style function in Go to connect to a PostgreSQL database."

**Iterate and Refine**

Review the generated code and provide feedback for further improvements.

"The generated Python function has a bug in the edge case for negative input. Can you fix it?"
