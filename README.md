## What's Vibe Coding?

Vibe coding is a style of programming that prioritizes intuition, rapid experimentation, and an uninterrupted “flow” of ideas over strict adherence to syntax or structure. In practical terms, the developer focuses on what they want to achieve (often describing it in plain language) and lets tools – frequently AI – handle the low-level implementation details​

The term was coined by Andrej Karpathy in early 2025 to describe “fully giving in to the vibes” and almost forgetting that the code exists​

-   [Andrej Karpathy on X](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383)  - "There's a new kind of coding I call "vibe coding", where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. (.) I'm building a project or webapp, but it's not really coding - I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works".
